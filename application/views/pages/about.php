                   <p class="about-p">The Philippine Customs service started many centuries back long before the Philippines was discovered by the eastern and western expeditionary. The Philippines had already a flourishing trade with the countries of Southeast Asia, but since money that time was not yet the medium of exchange, people then resorted to the barter system of commodities. The rules of baranggay’s were known as the “datus” or “rajas” collected tributes form the people before they were allowed to engage in their trade. The practice of collecting tributes became part of their culture and was then observed and followed as the customs law the land.</p>
